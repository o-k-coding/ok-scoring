# OK Scoring Components

Collection of libraries used for UI components. Libraries should be named using the following scheme:

- {lib-name}-mobile if the components are specific to a mobile application
- {lib-name}-web if the components are specific to a web application
- {lib-name} if the components can be used in web or mobile

Currently all apps in this repo use React based frameworks for UIs. If another framework/lib is used, consider creating a nested folder for those components named accordingly.
