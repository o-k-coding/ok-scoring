# Player Stats Service

General architecture:

Service will handle game data to calculate player stats, and storing that data in a DB table specific to this service.
That data can then be queried via API.

## Local development

This service currently runs all data in memory.

## Research

Using cluster mode

This was done following along with udemy course <https://okta.udemy.com/course/node-js-cluster> for learning

Used this exampleas well

<https://github.com/joseluisq/fastify-cluster-example>

When a request is sent, the main process will pass it to a worker process. You can determine which process based on the pid in the log

example

```json
{"level":30,"time":1666465566935,"pid":5797,"hostname":"LAPTOP-8B8RCQC5","reqId":"req-1","req":{"method":"GET","url":"/api/player-stats/b2c50e39-5b5e-4b4e-9ea6-34fab6cd4b7d","hostname":"127.0.0.1:3001","remoteAddress":"127.0.0.1","remotePort":37708},"msg":"incoming request"}
```

### Load testing

#### Vegeta

```bash
# when running cluster mode
vegeta attack -targets='apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/target.list' -rate=5 -duration=5s > apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/result-cluster.5qps.bin
# when running single mode
vegeta attack -targets='apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/target.list' -rate=5 -duration=5s > apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/result-single.5qps.bin

cat apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/result-cluster.5qps.bin | vegeta plot > apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/plot-cluster.5qps.html
cat apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/result-single.5qps.bin | vegeta plot > apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/vegeta/plot-single.5qps.html
# this is how you can combine multiple plots  vegeta plot results.50qps.bin results.100qps.bin > plot.html
# TODO I could probbaly combine the cluster and single?
```

TODO want to look into how to generate data. Maybe just a script that outputs to json would be the best option? Or a js script that just prints to stdout and pipe it in?
But also could be cool to figure out how to use jq for this for learning

```bash
jq -ncM 'while(true; .+1) | {method: "POST", url: "http://:6060", body: {id: .} | @base64 }' | \
  vegeta attack -rate=50/s -lazy -format=json -duration=30s | \
  tee results.bin | \
  vegeta report
```

#### Loadtest

Uses the loadtest library added as a dev dependency

-n max num requests
-c concurrent requests
-rps requests per second

Wonder if I could use a file instead?

```bash
yarn loadtest -- -n 1000 -c 100 -rps 200 http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/player-stats -P '{"key":"8e231613-1e16-4ec9-9366-2cfd1700edd1","date":"1663789971740","description":"Test Game","duration":null,"winningPlayerKey":"f3a96d83-4c0d-4739-8a49-48115a26f57d","scoreHistory":[{"key":"546d988f-50e5-49d6-b4fe-352f5f363691","playerKey":"b2c50e39-5b5e-4b4e-9ea6-34fab6cd4b7d","gameKey":"8e231613-1e16-4ec9-9366-2cfd1700edd1","score":23,"initialScore":0,"order":0,"scores":[{"key":"ee1b478b-1e9d-472b-8b16-638182964c94","playerScoreHistoryKey":"546d988f-50e5-49d6-b4fe-352f5f363691","score":23,"initialScore":0,"order":0,"scores":[23]}]},{"key":"2870af7f-632d-4f75-995f-da5ced263fa7","playerKey":"008b31f7-7d3b-45ab-aa3d-7ba46a1c2d7f","gameKey":"8e231613-1e16-4ec9-9366-2cfd1700edd1","score":12,"initialScore":0,"order":0,"scores":[{"key":"b3c08053-18a1-48cc-b60f-f1f748357738","playerScoreHistoryKey":"2870af7f-632d-4f75-995f-da5ced263fa7","score":12,"initialScore":0,"order":0,"scores":[12]}]}]}'
```

#### Artillery

install artillery globally <https://www.artillery.io/docs/guides/getting-started/installing-artillery>

```bash
artillery run apps/player-stats-service/test/performance/artillery/create_player_stats.yml
or
yarn player-stats:perf
```

## Purpose of this service

1. Should this service have an isolated db, take in full game objects via callers and use that to recalculate against the existing state it owns?
2. Should this service have access to all the data, so when invoked it pulls data (either new or all) and use that to recalcuate against the existing state?

I think for a first run, this service should be standalone, and only take in the required data to calculate stats.

## TODOS

- MVP using in memory data []
- API json schema for validaiton
  - Need to figure out where this lives... probably in this app dir since it is specific? but can we do better...

## Running with PM2

I am not sure exactly what the recommended way of running in prod is, I need to figure that out.

Need to read more <https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Guides/Recommendations/>

 but one of the courses I followed used pm2 for running in production.
This issue shows how to do with with fastify
<https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cli/issues/83>

```bash
npm i -g pm2

# cheat sheet
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 monit
pm2 stop all/app-name
pm2 delete all/app-name
pm2 list

# from the root
# only run one time to setup

pm2 ecosystem

yarn build player-stats-service
pm2 start

# can do something like
yarn build player-stats-service -- --watch
# then in another console
pm2 start apps/player-stats-service/pm2/player-stats-cluster-ecosystem.config.js
```

## RabbitMQ

Producer

Application that publishes messages

Broker

rabbitMQ, stores messages

Consumer

consumes/reads messages by subscribing to channels in the broker

AMPQ advance message queue protocol used by rabbitmq for messaging

```bash
yarn add amqplib
```

To run the app using the rabbit mq setup with pm2

```bash
yarn ok-scoring:mq:up
yarn build player-stats-service

pm2 start apps/player-stats-service/pm2/player-stats-queue-ecosystem.config.js
```

to use the cli tool with the docker service

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> rabbitmqctl <commands>
```

to use the web interface

<http://127.0.0.1:15672/>

## Redis

```bash
yarn add redis
```

luckily redis has it's own type definitions ðŸŽ‰

## NGINX

Web server following no threaded and event driven architecture.

Also can be a reverse proxy, load balance and caching server.

Benefit of reverse proxy: the proxy can know about the tls certs for many servers connected to it downstream.

uses a main process and worker processes.
